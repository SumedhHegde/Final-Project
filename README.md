# Title: Monte Carlo Simulation for a Basketball Game.

## Team Member(s):
Sumedh Hegde, Alice Bhopalwala

# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:
In a game of basketball, when there is 30seconds left on the clock and down by 3 points, Is it better to attempt a hard 3-pointer or an easy 2-pointer and get another possession (Fouling the opponent so that they are forced to make a free throw). 

## Simulation's variables of uncertainty
Home teams:
2-pt conversion rate
3-pt conversion rate
Offensive rebound and Defensive rebound

Opponent:
2-pt conversion rate
3-pt conversion rate
Offensive rebound and Defensive rebound
Free throw conversion rate
Free throw rebound rate

Time to shoot and Time to foul

## Hypothesis or hypotheses before running the simulation:
Hypothesis: If a team is down by 3 points with 30seconds on the clock, it is always better to score a quick easy 2 pointer and foul the opponents (preferably a weak free throw taker), and attempt another 2 pointers.

## Analytical Summary of your findings: 
The observations show that for every player the rate of the wins at 3 pointers is higher than taking a quick 2 pointer then attempting a second one. As a conclusion, we reject our hypothesis.
